# Solana Atlas

### A learning-first Solana developer playground

Solana Atlas helps developers understand Solana on-chain programs end-to-end using real, runnable code and clear, line-by-line explanations. It’s designed for developers who want to build strong **mental models**—not just copy-paste syntax.

## 🛠 How it works

- **Curated Templates** – Carefully designed Solana programs, from basics to intermediate concepts.
- **Line-by-Line Explanations** – Every important line explains what it does and why it exists.
- **Program Map** – Visualize instructions, accounts, PDAs, and CPI calls.
- **State Viewer** – See on-chain account state before and after execution.
- **Safe Sandbox Execution** – Local validator with pre-computed and live execution modes.
- **Web-first Experience** – No wallet, no setup required to start learning.

### Included Templates (V1)

- **Hello Solana** (program structure & logging)
- **Account Initialization**
- **PDA Vault** (PDAs & lamports)
- **Basic SPL Token Mint**

## 🏗 Architecture

Monorepo powered by **Turborepo**:

```text
apps/
  web      → Next.js frontend
  api      → API layer
  runner   → Sandbox execution service

packages/
  solana   → Program templates & metadata
  types    → Shared types
  config   → Shared configs
```

## ⚡ Running locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm 8+
- (Optional) Solana CLI

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

pnpm build

# Start development servers
pnpm dev
```

This starts:

- **Web app** → [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **API** → [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)
- **Runner** → [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002)

### Environment variables (minimal)

**apps/web**

```text
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**apps/api**

```text
PORT=3001
RUNNER_URL=http://localhost:3002
```

**apps/runner**

```text
PORT=3002
```
